Smith's name appeared on the national radar during the team's undefeated campaign, but his talent has always been there. He was a three-star recruit and Palm Beach Post All-Area pick for two seasons, as well as a district champion in the 400-meter sprint for his high school track team. Several schools around the country offered him, but he stayed in-state to play for UCF. Smith redshirted his first year on campus and was the team's Scout Team Player of the Year. In 2015, American Athletic Conference coaches named him the league's Rookie of the Year after catching 52 passes for 724 yards and four touchdowns on a winless team. He started all 13 games in 2016, leading UCF with 57 receptions for 852 yards and five scores as the team crept into respectability. He completed his career in Orlando with a first-team all-conference junior campaign, starting all 13 games and covering 1,171 yards and scoring 13 times on 59 catches. With head coach Scott Frost heading back to Nebraska after the season, Smith decided it was time to try his luck at the next level."}}
